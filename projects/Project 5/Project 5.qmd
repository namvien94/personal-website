## Assignment 1

This assignment involves reproducing key plots and results to analyze the **bias-variance tradeoff, function class comparisons, and KNN** testing performance.

## Assignment 2

This assignment is about plotting the decision boundaries of **LDA, QDA, and Logistic Loss** minimization on [BankNote_Authentication.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication){target="_blank"}

The BankNote_Authentication.csv contains 5 variables: (1) variance (2) skewness (3) curtosis (4) entropy (5) class \
The first four variables are features of banknote and the last variable is the class indicating whether this banknote is real or not.

## Assignment 3

This assignment focuses on applying and comparing supervised learning techniques—**decision trees, random forests, and boosting**—on the Banknote dataset. The objective is to evaluate and contrast their predictive performance based on testing errors after training models with specific hyperparameters.

## Assignment 4

In this dataset, there are 6 predictors X_1...,X_6 and 1 response variable. \
There are 3 predictors that should not be included in the regression model. \
Apply **LASSO** to figure out those variables. \

## Assignment 5

This assignment explores the application of **linear and kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models on a dataset, focusing on their performance and visualization. By comparing testing accuracies and plotting decision boundaries, the assignment highlights the impact of model selection and kernel usage in classification tasks.
