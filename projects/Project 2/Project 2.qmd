## Summary

**Introduction:**
This project aimed to predict Uber ride fare amounts based on trip and passenger data. The goal was to develop a machine-learning model capable of accurately estimating fare amounts using various features derived from the dataset. The project involved data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

**Process:**

- **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**
  - Imported and explored the dataset to understand its structure and content.
  - Identified and handled missing values and removed unrealistic records, focusing on trips within New York City.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Extracted relevant features such as trip distance using the Haversine formula and time-based attributes like day, month, and hour.
  - Encoded categorical variables and removed unnecessary columns for streamlined model training.

- **Modeling and Evaluation:**
  - Evaluated multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
  - Assessed model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test dataset.
  - Selected LightGBM as the best-performing model with the lowest RMSE of 3.75.

- **Prediction:**
  - Used the best-performing model to make fare predictions on the test dataset.
  - Saved the predictions to a CSV file for review.

- **Visualization:**
  - Created a heatmap of pickup locations to visualize trip density across New York City.

**Outcome:**

- Successfully developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models.
- Identified LightGBM as the optimal model for fare prediction.
- Delivered a cleaned dataset, predictive model, and visualization outputs for further insights.
