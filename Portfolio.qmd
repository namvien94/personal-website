## Hi, Welcome!

I build clarity from complexity.

Across my projects, I focus on **understanding users, synthesizing insights, defining problems,** and **creating scalable systems** that enable intuitive experiences, especially for **social, creator-driven, and community-centered products**.

This portfolio highlights how I translate ambiguous challenges into **structured, data-informed strategies** and early **product concepts**.


## 🧭 Case Study: [**Saciva**](https://namvien.netlify.app/projects/project%201/project%201){target="_blank"}  
### Designing User Ecosystem Segmentation to Improve Discovery and Community Formation

**Role:** AI Studio Fellow  
**Domain:** Social discovery • onboarding flows • segmentation • user insights • operational alignment


### 1. Overview

International students navigating the U.S. face fragmented information, unclear local differences, and difficulty building social ties.  

**Saciva** aims to reduce this friction by helping **over one millions international students in the U.S.** discover communities, locations, and resources that match their needs.

My work focused on understanding user ecosystems and developing a **segmentation framework** that supports more personalized and intuitive discovery experiences.


### 2. Problem

Students often cannot answer essential questions:

- *Where can I find safe, affordable housing?*  
- *What areas feel similar to my home environment?*  
- *Where are people like me?*  
- *Which regions match my lifestyle and needs?*

Filters alone cannot answer these — they lack context, proximity awareness, and environmental nuance.

Saciva needed a **user-centered, data-driven foundation** for recommendations and onboarding flows.


### 3. Goal

Create an ecosystem model that:

- Groups environments in ways students actually perceive them  
- Supports **personalized discovery** 
- Reduces cognitive load in relocation decisions  
- Helps product teams understand user needs at scale  


### 4. My Role

I led analytical and product-thinking contributions across:

- User needs exploration  
- Insight synthesis across multi-source datasets  
- Evaluation of clustering methods for user-relevant grouping  
- Early prototype development (interactive cluster maps)  
- Exchanging findings to the CEO and team for product direction  


### 5. Process

#### 🔍 a. User & Environment Research

Synthesized patterns across:

- University locations  
- Climate  
- Crime/safety  
- Cost of living  
- Income demographics  

**Guiding product question:**  
*How do these factors shape where students want to live and who they want to connect with?*


#### 🧩 b. Segmentation Strategy for Discovery Flows

| **Clustering Method** | **Clustering Approaches Evaluation** |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **DBSCAN**^[A density-based clustering algorithm that groups nearby points without needing a preset number of clusters.] | **Geographic Insights:**<br><br>DBSCAN reveals **high-density student pockets**, creating many small but meaningful regional clusters:<br><br>• **West Coast microclusters** (Seattle, Bay Area, SoCal) <br>• **Mountain West pockets** (Utah, Colorado) <br>• **Midwest city groups** (Chicago, Minneapolis) <br>• **Northeast metro chain** (Boston → NYC → Philly → DC) <br>• **Southern hubs** (Atlanta, DFW, Houston, Miami) <br>• **Florida as a distinct region** <br>• Gray points = **low-density/noise** points<br><br> <br>![](DBSCAN.png){width="90%"} |
| **Mean Shift**^[A clustering method that moves data points toward high-density regions to automatically discover cluster centers.] | **Geographic Insights:**<br><br>Mean Shift identifies **regional density peaks**, producing smooth and coherent geographic groupings:<br><br>• **PNW + Northern California** shared corridor <br>• **Southern California** as its own region <br>• **Southwest corridor** (AZ, NM, TX) <br>• **Midwest cluster** (IL, WI, MN) <br>• **East Coast subclusters:** New England, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast <br>• **Florida** as a compact cluster<br><br> <br>![](MeanShift.png){width="90%"} |
| **Agglomerative Clustering**^[A hierarchical method that merges the closest clusters step-by-step to form structured regional groups.] | **Geographic Insights:**<br><br>Agglomerative produces **clean, contiguous macro-regions**, revealing structured geographic boundaries:<br><br>• **Pacific Northwest**, **Northern California**, **Southern California** as distinct segments <br>• **Unified Southwest region** (AZ, NM, West TX) <br>• **Central U.S. + Texas** region <br>• **Upper Midwest** (MN, WI, MI) <br>• **Mid-Atlantic** and **New England** as stable clusters <br>• **Southeast region** (Carolinas + Georgia) <br>• **Florida** as isolated region<br><br> <br>![](Agglomerative.png){width="90%"} |


According to the findings, **DBSCAN** emerged as the strongest performer *(silhouette score^[A silhouette score measures how well each data point fits within its assigned cluster, with higher values indicating clearer and more separated groupings.]: 0.868)*, producing **294 meaningful regional clusters**.

This segmentation created a foundation for:

- Better onboarding (“What areas match your profile?”)  
- Personalized recommendations  
- Localized content relevance  
- Operational planning for community tools  


#### 🗺️ c. Prototype: Interactive Ecosystem Map

Built a Folium-based map visualizing:

- 294 environmental segments  
- Affordability  
- Climate similarity  
- Safety patterns  
- Regional profiles  

This tool improved stakeholder understanding and enabled **faster product ideation** for student discovery flows.


### 6. Outcome

- Generated insights that shaped early **product direction** for onboarding and discovery  
- Developed a segmentation model applicable to **community-building, recommendations, and localized user experiences**  
- Delivered a prototype that improved stakeholder clarity on user ecosystems  
- Helped define strategic opportunities for student engagement  


### 7. Alignment with TikTok’s Mission & Product Vision

- **Transformed fragmented student challenges into structured insights** by identifying patterns in safety, affordability, climate, and community factors, supporting TikTok’s vision of creating intuitive, accessible experiences rooted in real user needs.

- **Evaluated and selected DBSCAN as the most meaningful segmentation approach** through data-driven reasoning, contributing to the type of scalable understanding of user ecosystems that underpins TikTok’s personalized discovery and community-building features.

- **Developed an interactive ecosystem prototype** that clarified how users navigate their environments and form connections, reflecting TikTok’s commitment to empowering people with tools that help them explore, discover, and build meaningful relationships.
